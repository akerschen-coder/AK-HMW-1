## Languages Used 
HTML and CSS 

## What the website does 
A user face for the comapny Horiseon that goes into detail about their work, passion and different areas of improvement meant to help their clients. 

## Description
- Motivation for this homework was to understand how html and css work together to creat a user face and how to find corrections within the items given to us. 
- The reason I corrected this website was to make it more accessible, fix a link and simplify the css so that future coders would not be as confused. 
- What I learned was a better understanding of the correlation between HTML and CSS, HTML semantics, multiple tips and tricks to make a website look and react better and a major confidence boost. 

## Problems solved
In the header, main section, aside section and footer section of CSS, was condensed and simplified. 
In the HTML, semantatic HTML was implemented, links were fixed and accessible features were put in.
